# Hotel-managment-system


## Topics Covered:

1\. **Classes and Objects:**

   - The code utilizes object-oriented programming principles by defining classes like `Customer`, `Room`, and `HotelMgnt` to model entities within a hotel management system.

2\. **File Inclusion and Macros:**

   - The code includes necessary header files (`iostream`, `string.h`, `conio.h`) and uses macros (e.g., `#define max 100`) for defining constants.

3\. **User Input and Output:**

   - Input and output operations are performed using `cin`, `cout`, and formatted `printf` statements.

4\. **Arrays and Pointers:**

   - Arrays (e.g., `name`, `address`, `phone`) are used to store information about customers and rooms. Pointers are used for dynamic memory allocation.

5\. **Control Flow:**

   - Conditional statements (e.g., `if`, `switch`) are employed for decision-making in various parts of the program.

6\. **Loops:**

   - `for` and `do-while` loops are utilized for repetitive tasks such as managing rooms and handling user interactions.

7\. **Functions:**

   - Functions like `addRoom`, `searchRoom`, `displayRoom`, etc., are defined to encapsulate specific functionalities.

8\. **Data Structures:**

   - The program employs data structures like arrays and classes to organize and manage information about customers and rooms.

9\. **User Interface:**

   - The program provides a basic command-line user interface to manage hotel rooms, check-in, check-out, and view guest summaries.

## Features:

1\. **Room Management:**

   - Users can add new rooms, search for available rooms, and view details about each room, including its type and status.

2\. **Customer Check-In:**

   - The system allows customers to check-in by providing necessary details like name, address, phone, and payment information.

3\. **Availability Check:**

   - Users can check the availability of rooms and get a summary of reserved rooms.

4\. **Customer Search:**

   - The system supports searching for a customer by name and displays relevant details if found.

5\. **Check-Out Process:**

   - Customers can check-out by entering their room number, and the system generates a bill based on the duration of stay.

6\. **Guest Summary Report:**

   - Users can view a summary report of guests who have checked in, including their names, room numbers, addresses, and phone numbers.

## Conclusion:

The Hotel Management System provides basic functionalities for managing rooms, handling customer check-ins and check-outs, and generating guest summaries. It demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming concepts, user input/output, and control flow structures to create a simple yet functional hotel management application.

## Future Enhancements:

1\. **Database Integration:**

   - Implementing database connectivity for persistent data storage and retrieval.

2\. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**

   - Developing a graphical interface for a more user-friendly experience.

3\. **Security Measures:**

   - Enhancing security features for customer data and transactions.

4\. **Advanced Booking System:**

   - Implementing advanced booking features, such as online reservations and real-time availability updates.

5\. **Billing Enhancements:**

   - Adding more detailed billing information and payment options.
